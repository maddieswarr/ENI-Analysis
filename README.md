**1_process_raw.R**
This program processes the ENI's raw microdata according the corresponding metadata file which contains the registry design of the microdata. Attributes still need to be added to column names to create a data dictionary, but for now descriptions of processed variables can be found in comments under "Set and specify final processed variables" of this script.
